Feature: VPC setup between endpoints
We emit route additions for the relevant endpoints to the workers.

Scenario: First endpoint joins VPC
When a register event is received from "node1" for network "10.1.1.1/32" and endpoint "2001:1::1234:1234:1234:ffff"
Then 0 routes were published

Scenario: Second endpoint joins VPC
When a register event is received from "node2" for network "10.1.1.2/32" and endpoint "2001:2::1234:1234:1234:ffff"
Then 2 routes were published

Scenario: Third endpoint joins VPC with two attachments
When a register event is received from "node3" for network "10.1.1.3/32" and endpoint "2001:3::1234:1234:1234:ffff"
And a register event is received from "node3" for network "10.1.1.4/32" and endpoint "2001:3::1234:1234:1234:ffff"
Then 6 routes were published
And the routes are as follows:
| worker | network     | endpoint                    | segments                    | status |
| node1  | 10.1.1.3/32 | 2001:1::1234:1234:1234:ffff | 2001:3::1234:1234:1234:ffff | ADD    |
| node1  | 10.1.1.4/32 | 2001:1::1234:1234:1234:ffff | 2001:3::1234:1234:1234:ffff | ADD    |
| node2  | 10.1.1.3/32 | 2001:2::1234:1234:1234:ffff | 2001:3::1234:1234:1234:ffff | ADD    |
| node2  | 10.1.1.4/32 | 2001:2::1234:1234:1234:ffff | 2001:3::1234:1234:1234:ffff | ADD    |
| node3  | 10.1.1.1/32 | 2001:3::1234:1234:1234:ffff | 2001:1::1234:1234:1234:ffff | ADD    |
| node3  | 10.1.1.2/32 | 2001:3::1234:1234:1234:ffff | 2001:2::1234:1234:1234:ffff | ADD    |

Scenario: Third endpoint re-joins VPC with two attachments
When 60 seconds pass
And a register event is received from "node3" for network "10.1.1.3/32" and endpoint "2001:3::1234:1234:1234:ffff"
And a register event is received from "node3" for network "10.1.1.4/32" and endpoint "2001:3::1234:1234:1234:ffff"
Then 10 routes were published
And the routes are as follows:
| worker | network     | endpoint                    | segments                    | status |
| node1  | 10.1.1.3/32 | 2001:1::1234:1234:1234:ffff | 2001:3::1234:1234:1234:ffff | DELETE |
